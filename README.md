## Deliverables

The database of books can be found in a JSON-server. If you haven't already done so install json-server:

TO INSTALL: npm install -g json-server

Then start the json-server:

TO START: json-server --watch db.json

1. Fetch to "http://localhost:3005/books" and list all books
2. Clicking on a book in the Book List should add it to the Book Shelf
3. Clicking on a book in the Book Shelf should remove it from the Book Shelf
4. Each book can only be added to Book Shelf one time (Book Shelf should not have duplicate books)
5. Add an input that allows the user to search through Book List and still add books to the Book Shelf
