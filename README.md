## Deliverables

The database of books can be found in a JSON-server. If you haven't already done so install json-server:

TO INSTALL: npm install -g json-server

Then start the json-server:

TO START: json-server --watch db.json

1. Fetch to `http://localhost:3005/books`. You should get a response that is an array of multiple book objects that look like this:
   `{
   "id": 1,
   "title": "The Great Gatsby",
   "author": "F. Scott Fitzgerald",
   "img": "https://mppl.org/wp-content/uploads/0-214x300.jpg"
   }`

2. Render a list of books that show the book title and book img
3. Clicking on a book in the Book List should add it to the Book Shelf
4. Clicking on a book in the Book Shelf should remove it from the Book Shelf
5. Add a form that allows the user to add a book to the Book List (this should _NOT_ persist)
6. Each book can only be added to Book Shelf one time (Book Shelf should not have duplicate books)
