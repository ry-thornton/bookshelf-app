##Deliverables

The database of books can be found in a JSON-server, so before you start your React server, make sure to start your JSON-server on http://localhost:3005/stocks.

TO INSTALL: npm install -g json-server
TO START: json-server --watch db.json

1. List all books
2. Clicking on a book in the Book List should add it to the Book Shelf
3. Clicking on a book in the Book Shelf should remove it from the Book Shelf
4. Each book can only be added to Book Shelf one time (Book Shelf should not have duplicate books)
5. Add an input that allows the user to search through Book List and still add books to the Book Shelf
